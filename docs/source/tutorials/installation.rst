Installation
------------


.. note:: 
   
   While this package is still under construction you can get the bleeding edge version (to which this docs is written) 
   by cloning `this repo <https://github.com/TomFrederik/lucent>`_ and installing it from there via pip:

   .. code-block:: console

      cd $LUCENT_PATH
      pip install -e . 





To install the original version of Lucent you can use pip. Please note that some functionality might be missing.

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install torch-lucent
